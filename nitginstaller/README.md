# README
unofficial notitg installer as the result of 2 day learning how to make things with NSIS

# WHAT DOES IT DO?

## online version
the installer will grab the game file from notitg website and then extract the game files for you
## standalone version
game files already packaged from the installer

# DOWNLOAD
tbh probably precompiled and source code as well

# SOURCE CODE REQUIREMENT
- NSIS
- NSLCurl
- nsisunz

# FALSE POSITIVE
this is common issue with the nsis installer, the code itself is harmless
